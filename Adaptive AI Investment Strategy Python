Creating an adaptive AI for investment management is a task that elegantly, albeit somewhat complexly, 
combines elements of finance and machine learning. However, here is a framework that can function effectively
 as the core module starting point to create an adaptive AI algorithm 
trading strategy model for investment management, implemented using Python:
"""




# Load and preprocess investment data
data = pd.read_csv('investment_data.csv')
data.dropna(inplace=True)
X = data.drop(['returns'], axis=1)
y = data['returns']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize models
linear_reg = LinearRegression()
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train models
linear_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate models
linear_reg_preds = linear_reg.predict(X_test)
random_forest_preds = random_forest.predict(X_test)

linear_reg_r2 = r2_score(y_test, linear_reg_preds)
random_forest_r2 = r2_score(y_test, random_forest_preds)

if linear_reg_r2 > random_forest_r2:
    chosen_model = linear_reg
else:
    chosen_model = random_forest


# Predict returns for new investment opportunities
new_data = pd.read_csv('new_investment_data.csv')
new_data.dropna(inplace=True)
new_X = new_data.drop(['returns'], axis=1)
new_returns = chosen_model.predict(new_X)


print("Predicted returns for new investment opportunities:", new_returns)

"""
We are using two regression models, LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor, 
to predict investment returns based on historical investment data. 

We then compare the performance of the two models using the coefficient of determination (r2_score), 
and choose the one with the highest score to make predictions for new investment opportunities. 

Note that this is a very basic implementation that acts as a starting point for strategy 
development in this area. It can be expanded and refined for use in more complex 
investment management strategies to meet risk-return constraints and market characteristics as required.
